Autonomous Mobile Robot using FPGA-Based System-on-Chip Implementation

This project involves the development and application of a mobile robot platform with PWM-controlled motors interfaced with FPGA-based hardware reflecting system-on-chip design/implementation. The challenging aspects of this project relate to the FPGA implementation, including hardware support for PWM, and appropriate application software to demonstrate the capabilities and potential use of an autonomous mobile robot.

The hardware platforms for this project is [Intel DE0-Nano](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/fpga/de10-nano) board. This board has an FPGA chip with dual ARM processors which support Linux, and the board has an Ethernet connector that could then be used with an external battery-powered wireless router for wireless communication with a laptop computer. Finally, using analog-to-digital capability that is inherent in the platform, sensor input could also be used by embedded software as part of the robotic application.
